## Tech stack

- **Language:** Go 1.22+
- **Framework:** [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with [Outbox Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html) for reliable event publishing
- **Config:** Environment variables (no config files required for default dev)

---

## What this backend provides (for the frontend)

This service is the **backend only**. A separate frontend (or any client) can:

- **Health check** - `GET /api/health` to verify the API is up.
- **Plans** - `GET /api/plans` to list billing plans (id, name, amount, currency, interval, description). When `DATABASE_URL` is configured, plans are read from PostgreSQL via the `plans` table; otherwise the app falls back to the in-memory repository.
- **Subscriptions** - `GET /api/subscriptions` to list subscriptions and `GET /api/subscriptions/:id` to fetch one. Responses include plan_id, customer, status, amount, interval, next_billing. Currently placeholder/mock data; DB integration is planned.

CORS is enabled for all origins in development so a frontend on another port or domain can call these endpoints.

---

## Background Worker

The backend includes a production-ready background worker system for automated billing job scheduling and execution.

### Key Features

- **Job Scheduling**: Schedule billing operations (charges, invoices, reminders) with configurable execution times
- **Distributed Locking**: Prevents duplicate processing when running multiple worker instances
- **Retry Policy**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (1s, 4s, 9s) for failed jobs
- **Dead-Letter Queue**: Failed jobs after max attempts are moved for manual review
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Workers and the HTTP server complete in-flight work before shutting down
- **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor job processing statistics (processed, succeeded, failed, dead-lettered)
- **Concurrent Workers**: Multiple workers can run safely without duplicate processing

### Documentation

- `internal/worker/README.md` - Complete worker documentation
- `internal/worker/INTEGRATION.md` - Integration guide with examples
- `internal/worker/SECURITY.md` - Security analysis and threat model
- `WORKER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation summary

### Quick Example

```go
import "stellarbill-backend/internal/timeutil"

store := worker.NewMemoryStore()
executor := worker.NewBillingExecutor()
config := worker.DefaultConfig()

w := worker.NewWorker(store, executor, config)
w.Start()
defer w.Stop()

scheduler := worker.NewScheduler(store)
job, _ := scheduler.ScheduleCharge("sub-123", timeutil.NowUTC(), 3)
```

---

## Local setup

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.22 or later**
  - Check: `go version`
  - Install: [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- **Git** (for cloning and contributing)
- **PostgreSQL** (optional for now; app runs without it using default config; DB will be used when persistence is added)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/stellabill-backend.git
cd stellabill-backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
go mod download
```

### 3. Environment variables (required for secure startup)

Create a `.env` file in the project root (do not commit it; it is in `.gitignore`):

```bash
# Required for startup
ENV=development
PORT=8080
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/stellarbill?sslmode=disable
JWT_SECRET=ChangeMeNow123!Secure
ADMIN_TOKEN=AnotherStrongToken123!

# Required in production/staging (comma-separated https origins)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.example.com,https://admin.example.com

# Optional with validation
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_MODE=ip
RATE_LIMIT_RPS=10
RATE_LIMIT_BURST=20
RATE_LIMIT_WHITELIST=/api/health
READ_TIMEOUT=30
WRITE_TIMEOUT=30
IDLE_TIMEOUT=120
MAX_HEADER_BYTES=1048576
AUDIT_HMAC_SECRET=stellarbill-dev-audit
AUDIT_LOG_PATH=audit.log
LEGACY_API_SUNSET="Thu, 31 Dec 2026 23:59:59 GMT"
```

Or export them in your shell. The app now fails fast when required values are missing or insecure.

### 4. Run the server

```bash
go run ./cmd/server
```

Server listens on `http://localhost:8080` (or the port you set via `PORT`).

### 5. Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
# Expected: {"service":"stellarbill-backend","status":"ok","outbox":{"pending_events":0,"dispatcher_running":true,"database_health":"healthy"}}

curl http://localhost:8080/api/outbox/stats
# Expected: {"pending_events":0,"dispatcher_running":true,"database_health":"healthy"}

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/outbox/test
# Expected: {"message":"Test event published successfully","event_type":"test.event"}
```

## Operational playbooks

Keep the operational docs close to the code so the measurement workflow is easy to find during review and incident response:

- [Capacity planning playbook](docs/runbooks/capacity-planning.md)
- [Operational runbooks index](docs/ops/README.md)

The capacity planning playbook includes the reproducible snapshot script, the sizing model, alert thresholds, and the edge-case checks for zero-traffic and burst-traffic tenant profiles.

## Configuration

> **Quick start:** copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env`, fill in the
> required values marked `[REQUIRED]`, and start the server. Never commit `.env`.
> The example file is kept in sync with `config.go` and validated by
> `TestEnvExampleValuesPassValidation` in `internal/config/config_test.go`.

### Feature Flags Configuration

Feature flags can be configured using environment variables in several ways:

#### 1. Individual Flags (Recommended)
Use the `FF_` prefix for individual flags:
```bash
# Enable/disable specific features
FF_SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED=true
FF_PLANS_ENABLED=false
FF_NEW_BILLING_FLOW=true
FF_ADVANCED_ANALYTICS=false
```

#### 2. JSON Configuration
Use the `FEATURE_FLAGS` environment variable for bulk configuration:
```bash
export FEATURE_FLAGS='{"subscriptions_enabled": true, "plans_enabled": true, "new_billing_flow": false}'
```

#### 3. Priority Order
The system uses the following priority (highest to lowest):
1. `FF_*` individual environment variables
2. `FEATURE_FLAGS` JSON configuration
3. Default flag values

#### Available Feature Flags

| Flag Name | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `subscriptions_enabled` | `true` | Enable subscription management endpoints |
| `plans_enabled` | `true` | Enable billing plans endpoints |
| `new_billing_flow` | `false` | Enable new billing flow feature |
| `advanced_analytics` | `false` | Enable advanced analytics endpoints |

In production, set these via your host's environment or secrets manager; do not commit secrets.

## Using Feature Flags in Code

```go
import "stellarbill-backend/internal/middleware"
import "stellarbill-backend/internal/featureflags"

// Method 1: Middleware (recommended for endpoints)
router.GET("/feature", middleware.FeatureFlag("my_feature"), handler)

// Method 2: With default value
router.GET("/feature", middleware.FeatureFlagWithDefault("my_feature", true), handler)

// Method 3: Direct check in code
if featureflags.IsEnabled("my_feature") {
    // Feature code here
}

// Method 4: Multiple flags requirement
router.GET("/feature", middleware.RequireAllFeatureFlags("flag1", "flag2"), handler)
router.GET("/feature", middleware.RequireAnyFeatureFlags("flag1", "flag2"), handler)
```

## Testing

> See **[docs/dev-test-guide.md](docs/dev-test-guide.md)** for the full local
> development and test execution guide, including common failure
> troubleshooting.

### Unit tests

Unit tests cover config validation, service logic, HTTP handler behaviour,
circuit breaker, and the background worker. They use in-memory mocks and
require **no external services**.

```bash
go test ./internal/... -count=1 -timeout 60s
```

### Integration tests

Integration tests spin up a real ephemeral Postgres container via Docker and
validate the full request path — from route handler through service and
repository to the database — then tear the container down automatically.

**Prerequisites:** Docker must be running locally (or in CI with Docker socket
access). No manual database setup is required.

```bash
go test -tags integration -v -race -count=1 -timeout 120s ./integration/...
```

The test suite in `integration/` covers:

| Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|
| Owner fetches own active subscription | 200 with full plan + billing envelope |
| Unknown subscription ID | 404 |
| Soft-deleted subscription | 410 |
| Caller does not own the subscription | 403 |
| Missing `Authorization` header | 401 |
| Malformed JWT | 401 |
| Subscription exists but referenced plan is missing | 200 with `"plan not found"` warning |
| Subscription has non-numeric amount | 500 |
| 10 concurrent reads of the same subscription | all 200, no data race |
| `GET /api/health` | 200 |
| `GET /api/plans` | 200 |
| `GET /api/subscriptions` | 200 |

**Migration timing and startup race handling:** `TestMain` applies all SQL
migrations before any test runs. The Postgres container wait strategy requires
the ready-to-accept-connections log line to appear **twice** (once during
recovery init, once when actually ready), preventing false-positive startup
races.

**CI example:**

```yaml
- name: Integration tests
  run: go test -tags integration -race -count=1 -timeout 120s ./integration/...
```

## API reference

Base URL (local): `http://localhost:8080`

| Method | Path                     | Feature Flag Required | Description              |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/health`            | None                | Health check             |
| GET    | `/api/plans`             | `plans_enabled` (default: true) | List billing plans       |
| GET    | `/api/subscriptions`     | `subscriptions_enabled` (default: true) | List subscriptions       |
| GET    | `/api/subscriptions/:id` | `subscriptions_enabled` (default: true) | Get one subscription     |
| GET    | `/api/billing/new-flow`  | `new_billing_flow` (default: false) | New billing flow feature |
| GET    | `/api/analytics/advanced` | `advanced_analytics` AND `subscriptions_enabled` | Advanced analytics |

All JSON responses. CORS allowed for `*` origin with common methods and headers.

**Feature Flag Responses**: When a feature flag blocks a request, the API returns:
```json
{
  "error": "feature_unavailable",
  "message": "This feature is currently unavailable",
  "feature_flag": "flag_name"
}
```

---

## Database migrations

Migrations live in `migrations/` and are applied with:

```bash
go run ./cmd/migrate up
```

See `docs/migrations.md` for conventions and a production runbook.

---

## CI / Quality gates

Every push and pull request runs the following checks automatically via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

| Step | Command |
|------|---------|
| Build | `go build ./...` |
| Vet | `go vet ./...` |
| Test + coverage | `go test ./internal/... -covermode=atomic -coverpkg=./internal/...` |
| Coverage threshold | `./scripts/check-coverage.sh coverage.out 95` (≥ 95 % on `internal/`) |

Coverage artifacts (`coverage.out`) are uploaded and retained for 14 days on every run.

### Run checks locally before opening a PR

```bash
# 1. Build
go build ./...

# 2. Vet
go vet ./...

# 3. Test with coverage (internal packages only — cmd/server is the process entrypoint)
go test ./internal/... \
  -covermode=atomic \
  -coverpkg=./internal/... \
  -coverprofile=coverage.out \
  -count=1 \
  -timeout=60s

# 4. Enforce the 95 % threshold
./scripts/check-coverage.sh coverage.out 95

# 5. (Optional) Browse the HTML report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

> **Why `./internal/...` and not `./...`?**  
> `cmd/server/main.go` is the process entry point (`main()`). Go cannot instrument it as a unit-testable package, so it always reports 0 % and would drag the total below the threshold. All business logic lives in `internal/`, which is what the threshold enforces.

> **Security note:** Never commit `.env`, JWT secrets, or database credentials. The CI workflow contains no secrets; configure them via your host's environment or a secrets manager.

## Middleware order

Recommended order for the HTTP chain:

1. `recovery`
2. `request-id`
3. `logging`
4. `cors`
5. `rate-limit`
6. `auth` for protected routes only

Why this order:

- `recovery` wraps the full chain so panics from downstream middleware and handlers are converted into structured `500` responses.
- `request-id` runs early so every response and log line can carry the same correlation ID.
- `logging` runs before short-circuiting middleware so failed auth, rate-limit, and panic-recovery responses are still logged.
- `cors` handles preflight `OPTIONS` requests before rate limiting or auth rejects them.
- `rate-limit` runs before `auth` on protected routes to reduce brute-force pressure on authentication logic.
- `auth` should be attached only to protected groups so public endpoints like `/api/health` can remain reachable.

Behavior verified by tests:

- Middleware entry and unwind order.
- Request ID propagation across middleware and handlers.
- Expected short-circuit responses for preflight, auth failures, rate limiting, and panic recovery.

Security notes:

- `X-Request-ID` input is sanitized before reuse in logs and responses.
- The in-memory rate limiter is process-local and keyed by client IP, so deployments behind proxies should ensure trusted forwarding headers are configured correctly.
- CORS is currently configured as `*`; production deployments should replace that with an explicit frontend origin.
- The sample auth middleware validates a bearer token against the configured secret and is intended as a lightweight guard for protected groups until full JWT validation is introduced.

---

## Dependency Injection

Handlers are constructed with explicit dependencies instead of reaching into package-level state. That keeps startup wiring easy to review and makes unit tests cheap to write because services can be replaced with focused mocks.

Current boundaries:

- `internal/services` defines the interfaces and default placeholder implementations used by the API.
- `internal/handlers` validates constructor input and translates service results into HTTP responses.
- `internal/routes` requires an injected handler bundle and returns an error on nil wiring instead of registering a partially working router.
- `cmd/server` is responsible for composing concrete services and failing fast if startup wiring is incomplete.

Security notes:

- Constructor validation prevents nil dependencies from reaching request handling paths, which avoids panic-driven denial of service during misconfigured startup.
- Route registration returns errors for missing router or handler wiring so invalid startup state fails closed.
- Service interfaces keep handlers decoupled from future storage implementations, making authorization and data-access checks easier to test in isolation.

---

## Audit logging

- **Tamper-evident chain:** Each audit entry is HMAC-signed with `AUDIT_HMAC_SECRET` and linked to the previous hash (chain-of-trust). Breaking or removing a line invalidates later hashes.
- **What gets logged:** `actor`, `action`, `target`, `outcome`, request method/path, client IP, and any supplied metadata (e.g., attempts, reasons).
- **Redaction:** Sensitive fields such as tokens, passwords, secrets, Authorization headers, and values that *look* like bearer/basic credentials are stored as `[REDACTED]`.
- **Sink:** Default sink writes JSON Lines to `AUDIT_LOG_PATH` (default `audit.log`). File permissions are `0600` on creation.
- **Admin example:** `POST /api/admin/purge` demonstrates a sensitive operation. Success, partial success (`?partial=1`), denied access, and retry attempts are all audit-logged.
- **Auth failures:** 401/403 responses are automatically logged via middleware, with headers redacted.

---

## Structured logging

Application logs now use newline-delimited JSON with a consistent schema for both HTTP middleware and outbox/retry paths.

- **Canonical fields:** `request_id`, `actor`, `tenant`, `route`, `status`, `duration_ms`
- **Standard envelope:** every entry also includes `ts`, `level`, and `message`
- **Redaction rules:** bearer/basic credentials, JWTs, emails, and fields such as `authorization`, `password`, `secret`, `token`, `cookie`, `payload`, `body`, and `event_data` are redacted before write
- **Retry throttling:** repeated outbox failures are emitted once per throttle window, with `suppressed_count` on the next summary log so partial outages do not spam logs or inflate ingest costs
- **Safe payload handling:** publishers log metadata like `payload_bytes`, `event_id`, and `event_type` instead of raw request/event bodies

Example request log:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-04-24T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "request completed",
  "request_id": "req-123",
  "actor": "api-client",
  "tenant": "tenant-42",
  "route": "/protected",
  "status": 200,
  "duration_ms": 14,
  "method": "GET"
}
```

Example throttled retry log:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-04-24T12:00:30Z",
  "level": "warn",
  "message": "outbox event scheduled for retry",
  "request_id": "",
  "actor": "system",
  "tenant": "system",
  "route": "outbox.dispatcher.retry",
  "status": "retry_scheduled",
  "duration_ms": 0,
  "event_type": "subscription.created",
  "retry_count": 2,
  "suppressed_count": 17,
  "error": "db down"
}
```

Security assumptions:

- Request logs never include Authorization headers, cookies, request bodies, raw event payloads, or client IPs.
- If actor-like values contain emails or bearer-style tokens, the logger redacts them before serialization.
- Retry-loop logs are bounded by time window, which reduces noisy duplicate writes during downstream outages.

---

## Testing

```
go test ./... -cover
```

Tests include redaction coverage, hash chaining, admin action logging, middleware logging, and outbox log throttling behaviour. Coverage currently exceeds 95% in CI for `./internal/...`.

## Contributing (open source)

We welcome contributions from the community. Below is a short guide to get you from "first look" to "merged change".

### Code of conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive.
- Focus on constructive feedback and clear, factual communication.

### How to contribute

1. **Open an issue**
   - Bug: describe what you did, what you expected, and what happened.
   - Feature: describe the goal and why it helps.
2. **Fork and clone**
   - Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork locally.
3. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix   # or feature/your-feature
   ```
4. **Make changes**
   - Follow existing style (format with `go fmt`).
   - Keep commits logical and messages clear (e.g. "Add validation for plan ID").
5. **Run checks**
   ```bash
   go build ./...
   go vet ./...
   go fmt ./...
   ```
   Add or run tests if the project has them.
6. **Commit**
   - Prefer small, atomic commits (one logical change per commit).
7. **Push and open a PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin fix/your-fix
   ```
   - Open a Pull Request against the main branch.
   - Fill in the PR template (if any).
   - Link related issues.
   - Describe what you changed and why.
8. **Review**
   - Address review comments. Maintainers will merge when everything looks good.

### Development workflow

- Use the [Local setup](#local-setup) steps to run the server.
- Change code, restart the server (or use a tool like `air` for live reload if the project adds it).
- Test with `curl` or the frontend that consumes this API.

### Project standards

- **Go:** `go fmt`, `go vet`, no unnecessary dependencies.
- **APIs:** Keep JSON shape stable; document breaking changes in PRs.
- **Secrets:** Never commit `.env`, keys, or passwords.

## Security Considerations

### Feature Flags Security

- **Environment Variables**: Feature flags are configured via environment variables, which are secure and not committed to version control
- **Default Behavior**: Unknown flags default to `false` for security (fail-safe)
- **No Dynamic Loading**: Flags are loaded at startup only, preventing runtime injection attacks
- **Thread Safety**: All flag operations are thread-safe with proper mutex locking
- **Validation**: Invalid flag values are safely ignored and logged

### Best Practices

1. **Production Flags**: Always set explicit flag values in production; don't rely on defaults
2. **Secret Management**: Use your cloud provider's secret manager for sensitive flag configurations
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor flag usage and access patterns
4. **Audit Trail**: Flag changes are tracked with timestamps for auditing
5. **Testing**: Test both enabled and disabled states in your test suite

### Testing Security

The feature flag system includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Concurrent access and race conditions
- Invalid input handling
- Memory leak prevention
- Environment variable injection attempts
- Edge cases and error conditions

Run tests with: `go test ./...`

## API Contract & OpenAPI

This project follows a **spec-first** approach using OpenAPI 3.0.3. The specification is maintained in `openapi/openapi.yaml` and serves as the source of truth for all `/api/*` routes.

### Key Points
- **Contract Tests**: Automatically validate that implementation matches the spec (`go test ./internal/contract/...`).
- **CI Enforcement**: Pull requests are checked for undocumented endpoints via `go run ./cmd/openapi-validate`.
- **Versioning**: Versioned endpoints use `/api/v1/` prefix; unversioned public endpoints (like health) stay at `/api/`.
- **Legacy Alias Policy**: When a protected `/api/*` alias is retained for backward compatibility, it must reuse the same handler and RBAC as `/api/v1/*`, and only the legacy alias gets deprecation headers.
- **Contributor Checklist**: See `docs/OPENAPI_GUIDE.md` for the full checklist when modifying API endpoints.

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Validate OpenAPI spec and check for undocumented routes
go run ./cmd/openapi-validate

# Run contract tests
go test ./internal/contract/... -v

# Run all tests with coverage
go test ./... -cover
```
